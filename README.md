# WordFind
Simple word find program that takes either 1 or 2 files as command line argument. 1st argument is imported wordfind grid, while the 2nd one is a list of words to search for. If 2nd argument is not present then user inputs words to search for one by one. This was a project for school, with a strict input format and is therefore not very flexible.
